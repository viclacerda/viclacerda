### Hi, there! 🐈‍⬛🐈👩🏻‍💻

I'm Victoria. I have a degree in Languages with a specialization in voice and currently, I'm a graduate student of IA & ML seeking an opportunity as a Data Scientist.

You're gonna find here my <b>DS projects</b> and my study path in the tech career. 

The first part of the project title is the programming language the project is made. 
The last part shows if the project is either in Portuguese or English.

Feel free to reach out!
